title: First time using LiDAR data for a 3D map
---
I had heard about LiDAR data in GIS projects - it's a remote-sensing technique that uses laser light to densely sample the surface of the earth to produce 3D measurements (x,y,z). Pretty cool.

I came across [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/dEsV5tmrjdM?si=VrJyL9HEMP15YT10) which uses LiDAR raster data from the Netherlands to make a 3D city map on R. I've copied the [code](https://github.com/milos-agathon/make-your-3d-city#make-your-3d-city) and adjusted it slightly to make an image of the town I grew up in; Kuopio, Finland. The [National Land Survey of Finland](https://asiointi.maanmittauslaitos.fi/karttapaikka/tiedostopalvelu) provides various raster and vector data for free (shout out to Maanmittauslaitos!). See my code in [my repo](https://github.com/johannajokio/lidar-3d).

The code uses the `terra` package to overlay 3D measurement data onto an aerial image (orthophoto) and then renders it on `rayshader`. Now, this might still be a work in progress as I'm not sure why my map came out so smudgy and unclear. I increased the *lightsize* option, which helped with the grayness, but I didn't have my own HDR file to use under *environment_light*. It was my first time using `rayshader` and to be honest, I am not so clear on all the options as I don't have a GIS (never mind STEM) background! Another issue is that I get that black frame (which I saw someone else comment about on the tutorial video and it might be because of an old version of *rayshader*). 

Anyway, I really enjoyed making this - thank you Milos for the excellent tutorial and inspiration!
