title: First time using LiDAR data for a 3D map
---
I had heard about LiDAR data in GIS projects - it's a remote-sensing technique that uses laser light to densely sample the surface of the earth to produce 3D measurements (x,y,z).

I came across [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/dEsV5tmrjdM?si=VrJyL9HEMP15YT10) which uses LiDAR raster data from the Netherlands to make a 3D city map on R. I've copied the [code](https://github.com/milos-agathon/make-your-3d-city#make-your-3d-city) and adjusted it slightly to make an image of the town I grew up in; Kuopio, Finland. The National Land Survey of Finland provides various raster and vector data for free (shout out to Maanmittauslaitos!). 

What happens in the code is that you overlay the 3D measurement data onto an aerial image (orthophoto) using the *terra* package. Now, this might still be a work in progress as I'm not sure why my map came out so smudgy and unclear. It was my first time using *rayshader* and to be honest, I don't understand all the options as I don't have a GIS (never mind STEM) background! Another issue is that I get that black frame (which I saw someone else comment about on the tutorial video and it might be because of an old version of *rayshader*). 

Anyway, I really enjoyed making this - thank you Milos for the excellent tutorial and inspiration!
