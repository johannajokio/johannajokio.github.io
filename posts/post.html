	Welcome to my mapping blog! I'm Johanna, a data analyst who started working in R not so long ago. In this blog, I will use open access data to create maps of topics I find interesting and potentially highlight something that could be used for the public good.

	I  am focusing on maps at this point of my data science learning, and I think I like it because it combines my passion for travelling and eye for visual things.
	
	I've previously done a PhD in Urban Studies where I mapped housing tenure composition in different areas of Scotland and used it with other neighbourhood statistics.
	
	The website is made by pera, using Haskell, which was developed in Glasgow.
