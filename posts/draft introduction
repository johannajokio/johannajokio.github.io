Hello, is it me you're looking for

I  am focusing on maps at this point of my data science learning, and i think i like it because it combines my passion for travelling, eye for visual things,
and want to make things that have a practical purpose.
I've previously done a PhD in Urban Studies where I mapped housing tenure composition in Scotland's datazones.
I live in Scotland but am originally from Finland, also having lived in France and Germany. As I'm writing this blog, it is usually with my cat loafing on top of me 
or trying to sit in front of the computer.
