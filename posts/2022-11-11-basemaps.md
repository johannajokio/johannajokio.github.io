title: Playing with basemaps
---
So, before you add any data to your map, you need a baselayer. There are various styles and packages to get these, which I've recently learned about - you can just add boundaries of areas but also streets, terrain, or satellite pictures. I particularly like the [stamen](http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/12/37.7706/-122.3782) map styles. In this post, I will show two basemaps for the UK and Scotland. 

Often when you're mapping data you don't get to see the baselayer (although you can make the top layer transparent), so this is a chance to make something purely for aesthetical appeal!


```r
library(ggmap)
library(sf)

# Let's first try to make a watercolour map of Scotland with get_map by pulling a Google map
# A quick google search for Scotland's coordinates
scotland <- c(lon = -3.188267, lat = 55 )

scotland_map <- get_map(scotland, zoom= 13, maptype = 'watercolor',
                        scale = 1, source = 'stamen') 
```
This doesn't work for me, as Google now requires an API key, which you have to pay for after a trial. See `?register_google` for details.

Next, I searched for a way to get pretty stamen maps without google API and found a couple of blog posts like [this one](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/10/getting-started-stamen-maps-with-ggmap/) which were a lot more thorough than this ramble!

I got a shapefile with boundaries of UK countries from [ONS](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ons::countries-december-2021-gb-bfc/about).

```r
countries_shp <- st_read("CTRY_DEC_2021_GB_BFC.shp")

colnames(countries_shp)
str(countries_shp)

# Subset the sf object if we want to just look at Scotland
ukmap_sub <- countries_shp[countries_shp$CTRY21NM %in% "Scotland",]

# By using sf's plot, we can create a simple basemap 
plot(st_geometry(ukmap_sub)) # don't just do 'plot', as it will plot every variable and take ages
```
The basemap with boundaries looks like this: 
![Scotland basemap](images/scotland_boundarymap.png)

Next, to use "get_stamenmap", we need to create something called a boundary box, ie. just narrow down the piece of the world you want your map to be framed in. The *sf* package has the function *st_bbox* which should create these. In the next piece of code, I feed *boundary box* the *geometry* column which contains the coordinates that you want to zoom in on. However, *get_stamenmap* throws an error for me and I haven't yet figured out why.

```r
borders <- st_bbox(ukmap_sub$geometry)

map <- get_stamenmap(borders, zoom = 5, maptype = "toner-lite")
# this creates an error
# let's check the structure
structure(borders)
 'bbox' Named num [1:4] 5513 530254 470323 1220302
 - attr(*, "names")= chr [1:4] "xmin" "ymin" "xmax" "ymax"
 # it is a bbox object, but the numbers look weird.
```

However, you can define coordinates yourself like below, and feed *get_stamenmap* to *ggmap*.

```r
uk <- c(left = -11, bottom = 49, right = 3, top = 62)

get_stamenmap(uk, zoom = 5, "toner-lite") %>% ggmap()

# this gives us a stamen basemap 

# let's try another nicer style
get_stamenmap(uk, zoom = 5, "watercolor") %>% ggmap()
```
There we go! That's so nice you don't want to overlay any data on it ;)
